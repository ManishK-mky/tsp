Hlo guys, this is Travelling Salesman Problem , in which the best  path is selected finally.

Hlo friends , this project is based on travelling salesman problem.The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves finding the shortest possible route that visits a set of given cities and returns to the starting city.
The problem is typically formulated as follows: Given a set of n cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city?

In my project all the dots ar representing the cities and the lines as a distance.
The TSP is a notoriously difficult problem to solve, as the number of possible routes grows exponentially with the number of cities. In fact, it is an NP-hard problem, meaning that it is believed to be impossible to solve exactly in polynomial time for large values of n.
